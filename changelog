### Btrfs Assistant

1.0 - TBD
* A large refactor of the entire code base including touching almost every section of the code
* Removed all shell manipulation functions(sed/grep/awk/etc).  These functions are now performed in C++.

* Change the sort order of snapshots in restore mode so the most recent snapshots are first
* Added snapshot number to snapper restore grid
